                These reconstructions of forest composition in the northeastern US for the last 8,000 years help establish natural baselines, variability, and trajectories of forest dynamics before and during the emergence of intensive anthropogenic land use. These reconstructions are based on 1) the pollen–vegetation model (PVM) STEPPS, 2) a network of fossil and modern pollen data mostly drawn from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database (www.neotomadb.org), and 3) a vegetation calibration dataset based on a spatial statistical model of relative tree abundances from the Township Proprietor Survey (TPS) from the early EuroAmerican settlement period.  STEPPS is a process-based Bayesian Hierarchical Model that is run in two stages:  a parameterization stage based upon spatial data layers of forest composition and pollen assemblages, and a prediction stage based on fossil pollen assemblages.  The statistical modeling of the TPS forest data and relative abundances is described by Paciorek et al. (2016, PLoS One, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0150087) and is available at EDI as PalEON Products msb.paleon.1 (doi: 10.6073/pasta/8544e091b64db26fdbbbafd0699fa4f9) and msb.paleon.4 (doi: 10.6073/pasta/3c4844cfe8beff6b173b62034d1cb5d8). The parameterization of STEPPS and comparison to REVEALS, a different widely used PVM, is described by Trachsel et al. (2020, Quaternary Research, doi:10.1017/qua.2019.81). Both PVMs predict the observed macroscale patterns of vegetation composition in the NEUS; however, reconstructions of minor taxa are less accurate and predictions for some taxa differ between PVMs. These differences can be attributed to intermodel differences in structure and parameter estimates. STEPPS parameter estimates are similar between the UMW and NEUS, suggesting that STEPPS parameter estimates are transferable between floristically similar regions and scales.  The parameterized STEPPS model was then run for a network of fossil pollen records from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database to produce posterior estimates of forest composition at 250-year intervals for the last 8,000 years.  The work from this prediction stage was not published at the time of deposition of these records with EDI.  Hence, at this time, this EDI data deposition is the primary citation endpoint.  The prediction methods generally follow those described by Dawson et al. (2019, Ecology, doi: 10.1002/ecy.2856).

                     PalEON (the PaleoEcological Observatory Network) is an interdisciplinary team of paleoecologists, ecological statisticians, and ecosystem modelers. Our goal is to reconstruct forest composition, fire regime, and climate in forests across the northeastern US and Alaska over the past 2000 years and then use this to drive and validate terrestrial ecosystem models. We will develop a coherent spatiotemporal inference framework to quantify trends and extreme events in paleoecological and paleoclimatic time series. Variables such as forest composition, fire regime, and moisture balance will be inferred from corresponding paleoecological proxies, with rigorous estimates of uncertainty.
                 
        
                     These datasets will be applied to improve terrestrial ecosystem models in two contexts. First, we are developing specific data products, such as high- resolution settlement-era forest composition maps from witness tree and General Land Office data, that can be used to drive ecosystem models. PalEON will develop formal data assimilation tools that will allow the models we use to forecast on centennial scales to be informed by decadal- to centennial-scale data. Second, are developing data products for the purpose of model validation (e.g. fire-frequency reconstructions from sedimentary charcoal data). These long-term validation datasets will help us assess the ability of these models to capture past dynamics correctly, and will help us understand why their future projections are so divergent.

      STEPPS-fractional-composition_NEUS_83.30_percentile
      netCDF files with dimensions x (meters), y  (meters) and time (from 7955 BP to 205 BP, in 250 year intervals). The variables that store the 83.3rd percentile of the proportion of the posterior estimates of relative abundance are: "Ash","Beech", "Birch", "Chestnut", "Hemlock", "Hickory", "Maple", "Oak", "Oher conifer", "Other hardwood", "Pine", "Spruce", "Tamarack". There are also variables that store information about the projection. These variables are called:“projection” (NAD83/Great Lakes St. Lawrence Albers), “Spatial_Reference” (ESPG:3175), “Projection_Name” (Albers Equal Area)
