## TO DO

# Easy
## 1. See if we can run GJAM over time in a predictive framework
## 2. Decide how to include time without autocorrelation in GJAM
## 3. Test GJAM time
## 4. Make example presentation of preliminary results from tree rings

# Medium
## 5. Check how data were derived for the tree ring part
## 6. Get better climate estimates (PRISM? run GJAM for a whole bunch of different climate ensemble members?)

# Hard
## Get 2000 year time series for HF
## Make time series for other sites for tree rings
## Make time series for other sites for pollen
## Test GJAM with pollen time series
## Test GJAM time with pollen time series
