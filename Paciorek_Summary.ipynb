    "The immediate objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between the vegetation and the environment of Indiana and Illinois using the Public Land Survey (PLS)record of tree taxon presence and reconstructions of 15 environmental drivers. In so doing, we test the hypothesis that taxon presence is driven by a combination of environmental drivers and taxon covariance (or biotic interactions between taxa).\n",

    "In the longer term, we are interested in using this analysis as the starting point for two projects: (1) comparing the drivers of taxon presence between pre- and post- European settlement periods; annd (2) understanding the role of temporal memory in driving vegetation composition and biomass at different temporal scales."

    "The Generalized Joint Attribute Model (GJAM) was developed by Jim Clark et al. (2017) as a flexible framework for modeling ecological data. The model's advantages are numerous and include the following:\n",
    "1. Incorporation of multiple classes of response data (e.g., presence/absence, capture/recapture) in a single analysis\n",
    "2. Handling zero-inflated response variables\n",
    "3. Explicit quantification of covariance between response variables (e.g., presence of different taxa)\n",
    "4. Uncertainty specification in a Bayesian framework\n",
    "5. Easy implementation in R\n",

The censoring procedure implemented within GJAM requires a variable called \"effort,\" which can be thought of in our application of GJAM as the precision of the point-level observations of the response variables. To define effort, we used the distance from the corner that the land surveyor traveled to record the observed tree. We considered this a proxy for the precision of the observation because it represents the certainty that the tree recorded in the PLS record represents the actual trees at the point-level location of the corner. It is useful to note that it does not appear that our results are particularly sensitive to differences in the specific method of developing the effort variable."

    "I have started building a Bayesian hierarchical model that has similar architecture to GJAM. I envision the model working with fractional composition data so that it can be used with the current version of the STEPPS data product. Ideally, the model could be extended to other data types (e.g., continuous biomass) in the future. The objective of the model is to retain the useful features of GJAM (zero-inflation and covariance between response variables). Zero-inflation is important because the majority of taxa are absent in any given grid cell. Covariance between the fraction of each taxon is important because this allows us to identify biotic interactions via correlations that are not a result of similar abiotic niches. In addition, the model should include spatial covariance, which can be accomplished via a distance matrix, and temporal memory, accomplished by using previous time steps as regressors.\n",

    "I am interested in extending our use of the PLS record in Indiana and Illinois to a comparison between the pre- and post-European settlement eras. Specifically, I am interested in how the drives of vegetation communities differ between the two periods. I plan to use the model described above to investigate this question by investigating the magnitude of correlation between taxa in each era, as well as the magnitude of coefficients describing the relationship between vegetation and environmental drivers. For this project, I plan to use landscape-scale data products describing tree composition that I believe you have previously developed at least for the PLS period. This project would differ from Kelly's project by taking a more mechanistic approach to the same question, investigating *how* vegetation acts differently between the two periods, instead of identifying differences in the vegetation structure."

My hypothesis is that, because forests are long-lived ecosystems, the processes that drive vegetation demography over the long term can only be fully quantified when using data a long time periods. The short-term and space-for-time data that is often used to make predictions about vegetation response to climate change is insufficient to fully understand how vegetation responds to changes in climate over the long term. To investgiate this hypothesis, I will compare forecasts made using the same model, trained with data at three different time scales. The workflow is as follows:\n",
